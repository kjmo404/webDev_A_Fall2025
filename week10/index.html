        <h1>The AntiSocial Network: Memes to Mayhem</h1>
    <blockquote>We now know that if you spend a lot of time on the screen, you can create a mass delusion, that reality parts from where you are, and you can create something elaborate in your mind that is delicate and complicated,and it can be this really fascinating thing, and you can spend all day obsessing about it with other people. It can feel real as anything else. But what we're doing is building these elaborate grotesque fantasies out of our own unhappiness. - Dale Beran</blockquote>

    <p>This quote stood out to me because it highlights how our relationships with technology can become distorted over time. Platforms like 4chan were originally created as spaces for connection through sharing memes, but as the user base expanded and different groups began shaping the culture, the site became increasingly racialized and toxic. What began as a community built around creativity and fun eventually drifted far from its purpose. Instead of bringing people together, it ended up dividing them and amplifying harmful behavior. Ultimately, this quote serves as a reminder to step back from our online environments, “touch grass,” and reconnect with the real world so we can better understand its complexities, perspectives, knowledge.</p>
