        <h1>The AntiSocial Network: Memes to Mayhem</h1>
    <blockquote>We now know that if you spend a lot of time on the screen, you can create a mass delusion, that reality parts from where you are, and you can create something elaborate in your mind that is delicate and complicated,and it can be this really fascinating thing, and you can spend all day obsessing about it with other people. It can feel real as anything else. But what we're doing is building these elaborate grotesque fantasies out of our own unhappiness. - Dale Beran</blockquote>
