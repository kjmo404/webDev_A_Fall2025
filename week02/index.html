                  <blockquote>
                   <p>"Why should you care? Because the Web is yours. It is a public resource on 
                     which you, your business, your community and your government depend."
                  </p> - Tim Berners-Lee 
               </blockquote>
               <ul>
                   <li> Berners-Lee believes that the World Wide Web can be useful to different groups of people, allowing users to express their ideas, beliefs, and lifestyles.</li>
               </ul>
             </li>
            <!-- Quote two -->
                <li> <blockquote>
                   <p>"A neutral communications medium is the basis of a fair, competitive market economy, of democracy, and of science. Debate
                     has risen again in the past year about whether government legislation is needed to protect net neutrality. It is. Although the
                     Internet and Web generally thrive on lack of regulation, some basic values have to be legally preserved. "
                  </p> - Tim Berners-Lee 
               </blockquote>
               <ul>
                   <li> Berners-Lee stresses the importance of net neutrality; a principle that states that all internet service providers should treat content fairly and not have bias based on user, content, or organizations. He believes that this principle can help preserve free speech on the World Wide Web.</li>

      <li> 
                  <blockquote>
                   <p>"The effectiveness of the internet as a public resource depends upon 
                     interoperability (protocols, data formats, content), innovation and
                     decentralized participation worldwide."

               <ul>
                   <li> Decentralized participation - decision making and control is distributed to many entities as opposed to a singluar one.</li>
                  <li> The Mozilla Manifesto echoes Berners-Lee's sentiment about the world wide web being a public resource that can belong to many different entities instead of one central authority.</li>
